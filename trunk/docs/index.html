<h1>What is this?</h1>

<p>XPD is a cross-platform, open-source rewrite of a tool named Parameter Designer
(sometimes also named Keywin e-Bike Lab). The original program was written in
Visual Basic, and only the windows executable file was distributed, thus,
it is not possible to enhance or port it to other platforms.
</p>

<p>I started this project after I discovered how easy was to understand the serial
protocol used between the Parameter Designer and the e-bike controller. Besides,
I had a dream to be able to change e-bike settings anytime, anywhere. This would
be possible if it would be possible to change controller settings using some
portable device with serial port capabilities, for example my Nokia N900 phone.

<h1>Infineon e-bike controller protocol</h1>

<p>I wrote a more or less full description of the e-bike controller protocol
using Google docs.

<h1>Differences between XPD and its predcessor</h1>

<p>You may notice several differences between the way how XPD presents the
controller parameters, and the way how Parameter Designer used to do it.
I'll list here the most important differences, with detailed explanations.
<p>

<dl>
<dt>Many numeric parameters have 0.1 precision, while PD used integer numbers</dt>
<dd>Of course, nobody should expect the controller will control these values
up to the displayed precision. However, controller uses different units internally
for most values, and if you translate successive internal-units values to SI system
using integer values, you might get the same number for different amounts in internal
controller units. Thus I have decided to display the values with 0.1 precision, this
will let you choose between 31.9 and 32.2 amperes (which otherwise would be both
displayed as 32).
</dd>
<dt>121% speed? WTF? Why not 120%?</dt>
<dd>As said above, controller uses different units for most parameters, and they
are integer numbers in the range 0-255. For example, controller value 90 maps to
114.3% speed, 91 to 115.6%, 92 to 116.8%, 93 to 118.1%, 94 to 119.4% and 95 to 120.7%.
When these numbers are rounded to nearest integer, 120.7 is rounded to 121%, and
119.4 is rounded to 119%. That's why there's no "120%" setting at all.</dd>
<dt>The range of selectable values is SO MUCH larger</dt>
<dd>As I said before, the controller uses its internal scale for measuring
volts and amperes. This scale depends on the values of some components on the
board, and for some controllers the internal range would really map to this
extremely large real-world scale. This does not really mean that EB218 will
handle phase currents up to 1300 amperes (wow) in the real world, you still have
to make sure the actual power MOSFETs can deal properly with the selected
currents.</dd>
</dl>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>The basic usage of the program should be quite obvious for anybody who can
handle a computer mouse. The main program window displays a list of existing
controller profiles, you may create, edit, delete and apply profiles. In the
bottom-right corner of the window you may select the serial port to which
you connected the controller programming cable.
</p>

<p>The controller looks for profiles in two directories: first, this is the
program data directory (/usr/share/xpd/ on Linux, share/ on Windows), and
second, in the user's home data directory (~/.local/share/xpd/ on Linux,
"C:\Documents and Settings\Username\My Documents\xpd" on Windows).
